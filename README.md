# Bash Basics

## Bash is a terminal window. It emulates a Linux environment. DevOps works on Linux.

## Bash is a language.

pwd = print working directory (where am I?)

ls = list short (where can I go?) - lists everything in the current directory
ll = list long - more detailed list (date/time etc)

mkdir = make directory (create a location) - creates a folder

cd code = change directory to code

ls -a = will list everything (including hidden files - hidden file will usually begin with .)

touch = create FILES (touch example.txt --- will create a file called example.txt)

cd .. = go back one

rm = removes files (rm example.txt)

rm -r = remove folders (remove recursive)

cat = prints what is inside a file (for txts it will print the text inside)


There are two absolute locations.  ~ = beginning of user directory.   /  = root directory


echo ‘hello’ > example.txt = inputs hello into example.txt
